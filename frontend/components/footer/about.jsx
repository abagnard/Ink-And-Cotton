          <p>Ink & Cotton is run by a group of art aficionados and collectors
            who believe that unique art piecies do not always have to cost a
            fortune.</p>
          <p>We feature the works of artists on limited edition prints
            (ink) and clothing (cotton). Each collection is a true collaboration
            with the artist â€“ from selecting the artwork, sampling the merchandise and
            to sharing the resulting revenue.</p>
          <p>To make us even cooler, many of our artists have selected
            beneficiary nonprofits to donate a percentage of sales, as
            well as to facilitate art education programs.</p>
          <p className="last-line-about">So why wait to get apart of the action?</p>
